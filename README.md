# MacCrafter
Frontend GUI for managing MidJourney Prompts 



# If you just want to run it and not install anything:

Run MacCrafter.exe and read the help from the help button on the right toolbar.

------------------------------------------------------

# If you want to do development on it:

Install the latest version of autohotkey, then edit/use midjourney.ahk.

If you know anything about autohotkey, the script should be easy to manipulate and tweak.

Don't change the file structure (i. e. images or tmp folder locations)

The images folder contains images that shows examples of what to expect from a render using the choice by itself.

You can add new choices in the MJdata.txt file, then render using that choice to generate an example image for the images folder. It uses the choice name as a way to find it with an underscore between words in multiword names. When rendering, drag over the image after clicking to blow it up in discord. Don't use the "view original" version; it's too big. 

I pay for MidJourney and use this with the MidJourney Bot. This is the default target window. If you want to use it elsewhere, read the help secton on how to change the target.

If you make changes and want to contribute, please do so on the Github repo. 

------------------------------------------------------

To recompile, you'll need autohotkey installed. Right click on the .ahk file and choose "compile script."
